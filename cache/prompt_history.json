    "prompt": "who is trump?",
    "response": "Donald Trump is an American businessman, television personality, and politician who served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He was a member of the Republican Party.\n\nEarly Life and Career:\nTrump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, to Mary Anne MacLeod and Frederick Christ Trump. He grew up in a middle-class family with five siblings. After graduating from high school, Trump attended Fordham University and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in economics.\n\nTrump's business career began in 1971 when he took over his father's real estate company, Elizabeth Trump & Son. He expanded the company through a series of successful investments and acquisitions, eventually renaming it The Trump Organization. Under his leadership, the company built numerous high-profile buildings, including the Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nReality TV and Politics:\nIn addition to his business career, Trump also gained fame as a reality television personality. In 2004, he starred in the reality show \"The Apprentice,\" which was followed by several spin-offs. The show made him a household name and helped establish his reputation as a self-promoting, confident, and often provocative individual.\n\nIn 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States, running on an platform of anti-immigration policies, tax cuts, and a hardline stance against terrorism. Despite initial skepticism from many in the Republican Party, Trump won the Republican nomination and went on to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nPresidency:\nTrump's presidency was marked by numerous controversies, including:\n\n1. Immigration policies: He implemented stricter border controls, suspended temporary protected status for certain countries, and carried out a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations.\n2. Trade policies: Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and implemented tariffs on imports from several countries, including China.\n3. Healthcare: Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but failed to do so during his presidency.\n4. Climate change: Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement and rolled back environmental regulations.\n\nTrump's presidency was also marked by numerous investigations into his business dealings, including allegations of tax evasion, money laundering, and colluding with Russia. In 2019, he became the first U.S. President to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives, with both times resulting in acquittal by the Senate.\n\nPost-Presidency:\nTrump left office on January 20, 2021, after completing his four-year term. Since then, he has remained a prominent figure in American politics, continuing to advocate for conservative causes and maintain a strong social media presence. In November 2020, Trump was elected as the Republican candidate for President in the 2024 election.\n\nOverall, Donald Trump is a complex figure whose presidency had far-reaching consequences for American politics, business, and society as a whole.",
